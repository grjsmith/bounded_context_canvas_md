<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[Tomek Paczkowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomekpaczkowski/) and I were trying to create some well defined bounded contexts out of a set of existing systems. This had been tried before with workshops and asking questions with little success. Tomek and I came up with the idea of using [Notion](https://notion.so/) and the bounded context canvas on a call with the engineers who ran the service to try and extract the details. We created a the DDD group's bounded contect canvas in Notion and began using Markdown to enter the details. We used Cunningham's Law* to get the engineers to actively contribute and eventually take over the exercise and populate the information for themselves. This not only worked beautifully but it took us less than an hour to get a good first draft of each bounded context.

\* "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." - [Howard G Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#:~:text=%22Cunningham's%20Law%22,-For%20the%20mathematical&text=Cunningham%20is%20credited%20with%20the,than%20to%20answer%20a%20question.)

### Built With
* The ddd-crew's [Bounded Context Canvas](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas).
* We used [Notion](https://notion.so/) because that was the document management tool of choice in Pollen. This could be done in VSCode or any text editor with Markdown support.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

The only prerequisites required are the courage to look stupid in front of engineers and a willingness to frustrate them a little before they get the hang of it and take over.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
# Bounded Context Canvas Markdown Template

Created: Grant Smith Created at: February 4, 2022

# Name
>*Insert name of service here*

# Description
>*Describe the the service or context provides and how it provides them*

# Ubiquitous language
>*Record any context specific domain terminology*
>- *Domain term: Definition*
>- *Domain term: Definition*
>- *Domain term: Definition...*

# Inbound data
## Data provided by other contexts
>*Describe the data the service is dependent on in order to provide the benefits*
```yaml
# Data inbound from context1
   key1: value1
     key2: 
       key2a: value2a
       key2b: value2b
     key3: value3
     key4: 
       key4a: value4a
       key4b: value4b
       key4c: value4c
     key5: value5
```
```yaml
# Data inbound from context2
   key1: value1
   List1: ['value2', 'value3', 'value4']
```
## Events consumed
>*List topics the service listens to and the specific events being consumed*
>- *topic_name1*
>    - *topic_name1_event1*

# Business rules
> *Describe the logic the service contains. Describe actions it performs when the service receives a `query`, `command` or `event`.*
1. GIVEN `topic_name1_event1` occurs WHEN `key1 = value1` THEN do `action1`

# Outbound Data
```yaml
# Data outbound to context4
    key6: value6
```
## Events published
>*List topics the service listens to and the specific events being consumed*
>- *topic_name2*
>    - *topic_name2_event1*

# Assumptions
> *List the assumptions made by the service or bounded context itself or made by the team building the service*
>- *topic_name1_event1 only occurs when some real world event occurs*
